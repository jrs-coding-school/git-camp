# Warmup:  Command Line Calisthenics

Create the following directories at the command line.  We will delete all of these folders, etc. when were done.

- At the command line, make sure you are in your "code home" directory
- Within your "code home" directory, create a directory named 'delete-me' via `mkdir delete-me`.

  ```
  \your-code-home-will-vary\
  \your-code-home-will-vary\delete-me\
  ```
- change directory `cd` to the `delete-me` directory.

  ```

  \your-code-home-will-vary\delete-me\
  ```

- Within the `delete-me` directory, create the following directory structure/tree using Terminal/Command Prompt/CLI..

  ```
    \your-code-home-will-vary\delete-me\node-project-a
    \your-code-home-will-vary\delete-me\node-project-b

    \your-code-home-will-vary\delete-me\node-project-a\static\assets\images
    \your-code-home-will-vary\delete-me\node-project-a\static\assets\style
    \your-code-home-will-vary\delete-me\node-project-a\dal

    \your-code-home-will-vary\delete-me\node-project-b\static\assets\images
    \your-code-home-will-vary\delete-me\node-project-b\static\assets\style
    \your-code-home-will-vary\delete-me\node-project-b\dal
  ```
  - Open the `node-project-a` and `node-project-b` project folders using your atom code editor.  Inspect your file structure against the example above.

  - Within the directory structure/tree create the following files using `touch <filename>`.  

    > Windows users can use atom to create new files, if `touch` is not available.

    ```
      \your-code-home-will-vary\delete-me\node-project-a\index.js
      \your-code-home-will-vary\delete-me\node-project-a\readme.md

      \your-code-home-will-vary\delete-me\node-project-b\index.js
      \your-code-home-will-vary\delete-me\node-project-b\readme.md


      \your-code-home-will-vary\delete-me\node-project-a\dal\index.js
      \your-code-home-will-vary\delete-me\node-project-b\dal\index.js
    ```

  - Within each of the following project folders, use `npm init -y` to initialize and create the beginnings of a nodeJS project.

    ```
      \your-code-home-will-vary\delete-me\node-project-a
      \your-code-home-will-vary\delete-me\node-project-b
    ```
