# Exercise 6:  Tracking and staging changes to a file

Let's get some more practice tracking changes _to the file_ rather than the entire file.

- Add the following paragraphs to **newfile.md**. Save the file.

  ```
  Hello!
  Is it me you're looking for?
  I can see it in your eyes
  I can see it in your smile
  ```

- Add the changes to the staging area and check the status.

  ```
  $ git add newfile.md
  $ git status
  ```

- Add a H2 tag and another paragraph to the  **newfile.md**. Save the file.

- Do not stage the latest change.  Just check the status:

  ```
  $ git status
  ```

Did you notice that the file is listed twice?  The first change is staged and ready to be committed.  The second change is unstaged.  **If we were to commit, the second change would NOT be saved into the repo.**

-  Commit the first, staged change:

  ```
  $ git commit -m "Adding the lyrics"
  $ git status
  ```

`git status` should reveal the staged changes are committed.  However there are still changes to the file that have not yet been staged.

- Add the second change to the staging area and get the status.
- Commit the change.  Get the status, again.
