# Exercise: Hello World

Create a NodeJS project and git repository from scratch on your local machine using the command line interface.

- Using the command line interface (CLI), create a directory named **hello-world**, the beginnings of a **package.json** file, **readme.md** file, **index.js** file.

  ```
  $ mkdir hello-world
  $ cd hello-world
  $ npm init -y
  $ echo "# Hello World" >> readme.md
  $ echo "console.log('Hello World!')" >> index.js
  $ node index.js
  ```
- You should now have a **hello-world** subdirectory that contains a **package.json** file, **readme.md** file, and **index.js** file.  Running the `node index.js` command in the CLI  should display "Hello World!".  

- Create a git repository from within the **hello-world** directory by running the `git init` command.

  ```
  $ git init
  ```
  You should see the following message:

  ```
  Initialized empty Git repository ... <path to your project>
  ```

- Check the status of the repository (repo) using the `git status` command.  This command monitors the state between the repository and the files in your project's working directory.  

  ```
  $ git status
  ```

  You should see something like this...

  ```
  On branch master

  Initial commit

  Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	index.js
	package.json
	readme.md

  nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
  ```

  The status reports that you have three untracked files.

- Use the `git add` command to add these files to the repository.  Use the `git status` command after each `git add` to monitor the state between the repository and the files in your project's working directory.

  ```
  $ git add index.js
  $ git status
  $ git add package.json
  $ git status
  $ git add readme.md
  $ git status
  ```

  The last `git status` command should report the following status:

  ```
  On branch master

  Initial commit

  Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   index.js
	new file:   package.json
	new file:   readme.md
  ```

- Use your code editor to open the **hello-world** project directory
- Edit **index.js** by changing the message within `console.log()` and save the file.
- Run the `git status` command to monitor the state between the repo and the files in your working directory.  



  ```
  $ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   index.js
	new file:   package.json
	new file:   readme.md

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   index.js
  ```

Git knows the file has been changed but git has not been updated with the changes to the file.

- Tell git to stage the change and check the status.

  ```
  $ git add index.js
  $ git status
  ```
