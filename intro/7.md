# Exercise 7: History

This exercise will teach you how to view the history of your project by retrieving a list of what changes have been made using the `git log` command.

To browse the history of the project, Git doesn’t need to go out to the server to get the history and display it for you – it simply reads it directly from your local .git database.

Once we have listed the history, we can use a commit's "hash" identifier to `checkout` a previous snapshot into the working directory.

- Execute the `git log` to view the commit history including the SHA, Author, and Date

- Enter a 'q' to quit and return to the command line.

- Execute the following command to make the log more readable.

  ```
  $ git log --pretty=format:'%h %ad | %s%d [%an]' --graph --date=short
  ```

 Everything in Git is check-summed before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum called a SHA-1 hash, or simply the _hash_ or _SHA_ or _"Shah"_.  


- Note the listed hashes in your history log. Run the following log command again:

  ```
  $ git log --pretty=format:'%h %ad | %s%d [%an]' --graph --date=short
  ```

  Your output should display a commit history.  **The first 7 characters of each commit is the hash.  Each hash identifies a particular commit or snapshot.**  

  ```
  * b243573 2016-10-12 | adding more stuff (HEAD -> master) [tripott]
  * 21faa35 2016-10-12 | adding modified [tripott]
  * 255dfaa 2016-10-12 | adding the new file [tripott]
  * 169ddfb 2016-10-11 | initial commit [tripott]
  ```  

- The last item listed in the history log represents the first, initial commit.  Copy the hash id for the initial commit to your clipboard.
- Open your **readme.md** file.  Inspect the current state of its content.
- Run the following commands:

  ```
  $ git checkout <your copied hash>
  $ cat readme.md
  ```

  You should see something similar to this (your hash value will differ from the one shown below)


  ```
  $ git checkout 169ddfb
Note: checking out '169ddfb'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at 169ddfb... initial commit
╭─wottinger@CKSCLP025  ~/Dropbox/jrs/code/hello-world  ‹169ddfb›
╰─$ cat readme.md
# Hello World

  ```

Did you notice that the contents of the **readme.md** changed?  

Did that blow your mind?

## Back to the future

Let's return to the present time.  Let's go back to the future.  All repo's have a default branch named "master".  By checking out this branch we return to the latest version of our "master" branch.  

- Execute the following commands:

  ```
  $ git checkout master
  $ cat readme.md
  ```

- Take a moment and repeat the process of checking out different snapshots in time of your project and inspect the contents of the files before and after the checkout.
