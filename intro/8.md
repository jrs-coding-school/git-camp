# Exercise 8: Tagging commits

Having to look up the hash for a commit can get old. It would be nice if we could "tag" a commit for future reference.

- Let's make sure we are on the latest version of our program by checking out the master branch:

  ```
  $ git checkout master
  ```

- Let's tag the latest version with a tag named "v1.0".

  ```
  $ git tag v1.0
  ```

- Let's tag the version prior to v1.0 with the tag "v0.9".  Run the `git log` command to find the commit prior to the current.  Use `git checkout` with the correct hash to go back in time.  Use `git tag` to tag that commit with a friendly name.  

  ```
  $ git log --pretty=format:'%h %ad | %s%d [%an]' --graph --date=short
  $ git checkout <hash>
  $ git tag v0.9
  ```

- List all the tags

  ```
  $ git tag
  ```

- Now that we have added a couple of tags. We can easily go back and forth in points in time using `git checkout` and the tag name.  

  ```
  $ git checkout v1.0
  $ git checkout v0.9
  $ git log --pretty=format:'%h %ad | %s%d [%an]' --graph --date=short
  ```

  Carefully review the messages after each checkout.  When you used `git log`, note how the hash is "tagged".

  Did you notice the `HEAD`.  It denotes the currently checkout out commit.  

- Checkout v0.9 and run the log.  Where is the `HEAD`?  Count the number of commits listed in the log.
- Checkout v1.0 and run the log.  Where is the `HEAD`?  Count the number of commits listed in the log.
