# Exercise:  Undoing committed changes

Let's revert changes that have been committed to your local repo (.git database).  We will use the `get revert HEAD` command to generate a commit that removes the committed changes.

- Change a file in your project.  Save the file.
- Stage the file.  
- Commit the file.
- Revert the commit.  Git will try and pop the file into an editor (such as Atom). You can choose to edit the commit message and save the file or just close the editor.  

  ```
  $ git revert HEAD
  ```

  Use the `--no-edit` option to skip the process of editing the file.

  ```
  $ git revert HEAD --no-edit
  ```

- Check the log to see the newly generated commit that removed the committed change.  

  ```
  $ git log --pretty=format:'%h %ad | %s%d [%an]' --graph --date=short
  ```

  here is the log history...

  ```
  * 975e304 2016-10-12 | Revert "Oops" (HEAD -> master) [tripott]
  * ca503ff 2016-10-12 | Oops [tripott]
  * b243573 2016-10-12 | adding more stuff (tag: v1.0) [tripott]
  * 21faa35 2016-10-12 | adding modified (tag: v0.9) [tripott]
  * 255dfaa 2016-10-12 | adding the new file [tripott]
  * 169ddfb 2016-10-11 | initial commit [tripott]
  ```

- Review the contents of the file.  You should see that its contents have been converted.  Unfortunately, our mistake is forever written in the annals of git history.  This tends to make one _sad_. 

** TOP TIP **

We used the `HEAD` option to revert back to the last commit we made; but,  you can provide a hash value or tag name in place of `HEAD` to revert to a commit farther back in time.
