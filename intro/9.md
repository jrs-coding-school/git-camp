# Exercise 9: Undoing changes (before you stage the changes)

You can undo changes to the _working directory_ before those changes are staged.

- Move the HEAD to the latest commit

  ```
  $ git checkout master
  ```

- Make a change to the readme.md file.  Save the change.

- Check the status.  You'll see that the file has been modified but not yet staged.

  ```
  $ git status
  ```

- Revert the changes to the individual file in the working directory using `git checkout`

  ```
  $ git checkout <file name>
  $ git status
  $ cat readme.md
  ```

  You should notice there are no modifications in the working directory.  Your changes have been reverted to the previous snapshot of the file.
