# Exercise 5:  Managing Conflicts

As we learned in our previous two exercises, merging brings changes from one branch into another branch. If you remember we have a change within our `feature-a` branch where we added some markdown content in the **readme.md** file (the last line):  

- Checkout the `feature-a` branch.  Open the **readme.md** file and note the contents of the file. The last line has not been merged into the `master` branch, yet. (The contents of your file will vary.)

  ** readme.md within the `feature-a` branch **

  ```
  # Branching is fun

  Here is my favorite album:

  Here is a change within the `feature-a` branch.

  ```

  When merging branches it is common to have conflicts when two developers have edited the same file.  We will make a change in `master` that conflicts with the changes in `feature-a`. We will resolve the conflicts when we merge.

- Checkout the `master` branch.  Open the **readme.md** file file and note the contents. (The contents of your file will vary.)

  ```
  # Branching is fun

  Here is my favorite album:

  ![love-pixies](/static/pixies-doolittle.png)
  ```

- Create an edit within the **readme.md** file that will conflict with the change in the `feature-a` branch when the two branches are merged together:

  ```
  # Branching is fun

  Here is my favorite album:

  ![love-pixies](/static/pixies-doolittle.png)

  THIS LINE SHOULD CONFLICT WITH THE CHANGE COMING IN FROM feature-a.
  ```

- Now it's time to learn how to handle conflicts during a merge.  Let's attempt to merge the changes from `feature-a` into the `master` branch:

  ```
  $ git checkout master
  $ git merge feature-a
  ```

  After attempting the merge, you should be informed of a conflict.

  ```
  Auto-merging readme.md
  CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in readme.md
  Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
  ```

- Look at the contents of **readme.md**.  You should see something similar to this.  Your contents will vary:

  ```
  <<<<<<< HEAD
  THIS LINE SHOULD CONFLICT WITH THE CHANGE COMING IN FROM feature-a.
  =======
  Here is a change within the `feature-a` branch.  This should conflict.
  >>>>>>> feature-a
  ```

- Resolve the conflict.

  The `<<<<<<< HEAD` denotes the beginning of the conflict while the `>>>>>>> feature-a` denotes the end of the conflict.  The `=======` divides the contents from the `master` branch from the contents of the `feature-a` branch.  

  To resolve the conflict, you will need to remove the `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `>>>>>>> feature-a`, and the `=======`.  You should also decide which content you wish to keep in the file.  You can keep the content from `master` or `feature-a` or you can blend the two together.  

  Here is an example of resolving a merge conflict:

  ```
  # Branching is fun

  Here is my favorite album:

  ![love-pixies](/static/pixies-doolittle.png)

  I HAVE RESOLVED THE CONFLICT BY REPLACING ALL THE GOO WITH THIS LINE.  
  ```

- Stage and commit the change to the `master` branch.

  ```
  $ git add readme.md
  $ git status
  $ git commit -m 'resolving merge conflict from feature-a'
  $ git log --pretty=format:'%h %ad | %s%d [%an]' --graph --date=short --all
  ```

  Here is the results of the log (your mileage may vary):
