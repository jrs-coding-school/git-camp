# Exercise 2:  Create a new feature in the branch.

In this exercise we will use the `git branch` command to list the branches in the repo and verify which branch that `HEAD` is currently pointing to.  

Let's create a new feature by adding an image of you favorite album to the **readme.md** file.

- Verify what branch `HEAD` is currently pointing to:

  ```
  $ git branch
  ```
- We want to be in the `feature-album-images` branch.  Use `git checkout feature-album-images` to switch to the correct branch, if necessary.

  ```
  $ git checkout feature-album-images
  ```

- Within your **branch-fun** project directory, create a sub-folder named **static**.
- Add an image file of your favorite album to the **static** folder.
- Open the **readme.md** file in your text editor, such as Atom.  
- Add markdown to display an inline image of your favorite album using the following markdown syntax:

  * An exclamation mark: !
  * Followed by a set of square brackets, containing the alt attribute text for the image
  * Followed by a set of parentheses, containing the URL or path to the image

  ```
  ![Alt text](/static/my-favorite-album.png)
  ```

  Here is an example:

  ```
  # Branching is fun

  Here is my favorite album:

  ![love-pixies](/static/pixies-doolittle.png)
  ```

- Save, stage, and commit the changes to the repo.
- Verify that there is nothing to commit and the working tree is clean.
- Check out the `master` branch.

  ```
  $ git checkout master
  ```

- Use `git branch` to verify that the `HEAD` is pointing to the `master` branch.
- Open the **readme.md** file.  Where did your changes go?  Where is your image?

  ![mind blown](/static/assets/img/cena-mind-blown.gif)

- Close the **readme.md** file.
- Check out the `feature-album-images` branch, again.

  ```
  $ git checkout feature-album-images
  ```

- Use `git branch` to verify that the `HEAD` is pointing to the `feature-album-images` branch.

- Open the **readme.md** file, again.
