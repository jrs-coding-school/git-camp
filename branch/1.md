# Exercise 1:  Create a new "branch-fun" project

We are done with our hello-world project.  In this exercise we will create a new NodeJS application to play around with branching in Git.

- Create a new NodeJS application by running the following commands:

```
$ mkdir branch-fun
$ cd branch-fun
$ npm init -y
$ echo "# Branching is fun" >> readme.md
$ echo "console.log('Branching in Git rocks')" >> index.js
$ node index.js
```
- You should now have a **branch-fun** subdirectory that contains a **package.json** file, **readme.md** file, and **index.js** file.  Running the `node index.js` command in the CLI  should display "Branching in Git rocks".  

- Create a git repository from within the **branch-fun** directory by running the `git init` command.

  ```
  $ git init
  ```
  You should see the following message:

  ```
  Initialized empty Git repository ... <path to your project>
  ```

- Check the status of the repository (repo) using the `git status` command.  This command monitors the state between the repo and the files in your project's working directory.  

  ```
  $ git status
  ```
  The status reports that you have three untracked files.

- Use the `git add` command to add these files to the repository.  Use the `git status` command after each `git add` to monitor the state between the repository and the files in your project's working directory.

  ```
  $ git add index.js
  $ git status
  $ git add package.json
  $ git status
  $ git add readme.md
  $ git status
  ```

  The last `git status` command should report the following status:

  ```
  On branch master

  Initial commit

  Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   index.js
	new file:   package.json
	new file:   readme.md
  ```

- Commit the staged changes into the repo with `git commit`.

  ```
  $ git commit -m "initial commit"
  $ git status
  ```

- Run `git log` to view where the `HEAD` is pointing.

  ```
  $ git log --pretty=format:'%h %ad | %s%d [%an]' --graph --date=short
  ```

- Create a new branch called `feature-album-images`. You do this with the git branch command:

 ```
 $ git branch feature-album-images
 ```

 - Run `git log` again to view where the `HEAD` is pointing.

   ```
   $ git log --pretty=format:'%h %ad | %s%d [%an]' --graph --date=short
   ```
- Switch to the new branch and view the log again.

  ```
  $ git checkout feature-album-images
  $ git log --pretty=format:'%h %ad | %s%d [%an]' --graph --date=short
  ```
